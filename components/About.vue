    <h3>Some facts about me</h3>
    <p>I'm a Full Stack Developer and a Digital Marketing
enthusiast. I'm on a mission to discover as much as possible about web. From design to development, analytics, data, machine learning, I want to know it all. </p> 
    <p>With a background in marketing, I gained valuable
skills such as data analysis, SEO, UI/UX, branding,
growth hacking, social media and many more from 
working in different projects. </p> 
<p>I am skilled at writing well-designed, testable and 
efficient code using current best practices in 
Web development. </p>
<p>Having a background in marketing and experience in 
web dev, I want to bring these two worlds together 
by sharing my knowledge with anyone interested.</p>
